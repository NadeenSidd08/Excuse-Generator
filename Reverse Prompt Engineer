I need your advice right now. I want you to take on the persona of a prompt engineer because obviously you and I went back and forth quite a bit in this conversation and I feel like I could have given you way better instructions to avoid all this back-and-forth. So you knew exactly what I was going for and understood exactly how to steer me in the right direction and basically make this into a one-step process using one prompt vs. all of this back-and-forth that we've had.

Taking on this persona, can you write a world-class prompt in unformatted Markdown that I can easily copy-paste so I can use it for so that I can use it to recreate this app in one shot vs. multiple shots.
